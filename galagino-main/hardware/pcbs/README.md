# Galagino PCB set

The Galagino PCB set is meant to make assembly much easier.
It consists of three PCBs. One is for the display, one for the
ESP32 and one for the joystick.

The joystick comes with a freecad design for matching plastic parts:

- The main cover [controlboard_base.stl](controlboard_base.stl)
- The actuator that pusges against the direction buttons [controlboard_actuator.stl](controlboard_actuator.stl)
- The joystick control knob [controlboard_knob.stl](controlboard_knob.stl)
- Two raiser to be mounted below the start and fire button [btn_raiser.stl](btn_raiser.stl)

The joystick uses standard 6x6mm through-hole buttons with the legs
bent 90 deg outwards to go through the PCB and the other legs being
cut.
