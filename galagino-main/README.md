[Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man),
[Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) and
[Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)) are three of the most
iconic arcade machines of all times and are listed on places #1 to #3
on the [Killer List of Video Games](http://www.klov.net).

Especially Pac-Man and Galaga have been remade and emulated many
times. So far the cheapest and smallest system able to do a faithful
emulation of the original arcade machines was the raspberry pi. But
even the much cheaper ESP32 should be able to easily emulate a machine
from the early â€™80s, shouldn't it?

Well, things are not that easy. The Galaga arcade was driven by three
Z80 CPUs, each running at 3Mhz. Additionally the arcade machine
included two more CPUs, one for button and coin handling and one for audio
support. And finally the hardware itself had dedicated support
for simple wavetable audio, tilemap graphics and up to 64 sprites.
The video resultion was 224 by 288 pixels.

The ESP32 on the other hand
comes with two cores running at 240MHz. But it lacks dedicated video
hardware. Emulating the various CPUs as well as the handling of
audio and graphics turned out to be challenging for the ESP32.

Cheap TFT screens with a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels are avaialable
in various sizes from 2.0 inch to 3.2 inch allowing for a very small
and cheap *galagino* setup.

These small displays usually allow for SPI clock rates of up to 40MHz
allowing for a max screen refresh rate of ~30Hz. This is exactly half
the refresh rate of the original arcade machine. 30Hz is sufficient
for a very fluid gameplay. However, with displays coping with 80MHz
SPI clock, Galagino will run at full 60Hz refresh.

## Hardware

### Original Hardware
The hardware is built around one of those cheap ESP32 development
boards like the ESP32 Devkit V4 depicted in the images below. The
components needed for the breadboard setup are listed below. If you
plan to build the [cabinet](hardware/cabinet) instead you might want
to make sure you [order the exact parts](./hardware) that
aren't only electrically compatible but also mechanically.

* ESP32 development board (e.g. [Devkit V4](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc))
* A 320x240 SPI TFT screen (no touch needed)
  * Either a ILI9341 based screen as depicted, or
  * a ST7789 based screen with 320x240 pixels
* An audio amplifier and speaker
  * e.g. a [PAM8302A](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2130) and a 3W speaker (as seen in the photos), or
  * a [Keyestudio SC8002B](https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-sc8002b-audio-power-amplifier-speaker-module-for-arduino-player), or similar 
* five push buttons, or
* one push button and a five way joystick breakout (for Pac-Man and Donkey Kong)
* breadboard and wires

The entire setup should be connected as depicted below. The Devkit is
too wide for the breadboard leaving no space above it to connect
wires. Thus the wires going to the top pin row of the Devkit are
placed underneath the DevKit with the connections done as shown in the
image below. See [galagino/config.h](galagino/config.h) for the button
mappings.

This setup with five buttons works fine for Galaga since there is no
vertical movement in the game that requires a joystick. A joystick is
needed for Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. The joystick based setup would
then be wired in the following way:

### "Cheap Yellow Display"
The ESP32-2432S028R A.K.A. the [Cheap Yellow Display](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display) is an ESP32 Board that comes with the majority of hardware required to build a Galagino device.

![Cheap Yellow Display](images/CheapYellowDisplay.png)

Hardware Needed:
- Cheap Yellow Display
- [A Nintendo Wii nunchuck and adaptor](hardware/NUNCHUCK.MD) - This can be connected to the JST connector labled "CN1" with the cable included with the display
- A speaker - This can be attached to the display with a 1.25mm JST connector to the connector labled "SPEAK" (or soldered)

Note: The `Start` button is connected to the "boot" button on the board.

To get the project working on the Cheap Yellow Display, just uncomment the `#define CHEAP_YELLOW_DISPLAY_CONF` line in [galagino/config.h](galagino/config.h)

## Software

**Important notice 1:** You really need to use the Arduino IDE as it
provides the optimization settings required for sufficient
perfgormance of Galaga and Digdug by default. E.g. PlatformIO doesn't
seem to enable enough optimization.

**Important notice 2:** I2S/DAC support seems to be [broken in the
ESP32 board package version 2.0.10 and
up](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/8467). Please
use ESP32 board package 2.0.9 or older for a clean sound.

The software consists of three parts:

* The [Galagino specific code](galagino/) contained in this repository
* The orignal ROM files
    * [Galaga (Namco Rev. B ROM)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=galaga+namco+b+rom)
    * [Pac-Man (Midway)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=pacman+midway+arcade+rom)
    * [Donkey Kong (US set 1)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=donkey+kong+arcade+rom)
    * [Frogger](https://www.bing.com/search?q=frogger+arcade+rom)
    * [Digdug](https://www.bing.com/search?q=digdug+arcade+rom)
    * [1942](https://www.bing.com/search?q=1942+arcade+rom)	
* A [Z80 software emulation](https://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/Z80-081707.zip) by [Marat Fayzullin](https://fms.komkon.org/)

Galagino uses code that is not freely available and thus not included in this
repository. Preparing the firmware thus consists of a few additional steps:

* The ROM files have to be placed in the [roms directory](roms/), together with the ZIP file containing the Z80 emulator.
* A set of [python scripts](romconv/) is then being used to convert and
 patch the ROM data and emulator code and to include the resulting code into the
galagino sketch directory.
* The same scripts are afterwards being used to convert [audio sample files](./samples) into the desired format.

The [ROM conversion](./romconv) as well as the [audio sample
conversion](./samples) create a whole bunch of additional files in the
[galagino directory](./galagino). Please check the README's in the
[romconv](./romconv) and [samples](./samples) directories for further
instructions.

With all these files in place, the galagino.ino sketch can be loaded
into the [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2). The
Arduino IDE must have the [ESP32 board support](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
installed and the appropriate board like e.g. the
*ESP32 Dev Module* should be selected. Finally the default core used
by Arduino should be 1 (this is the default) as Galagino will use core 0
for audio and video emulation. Furthermore the FastLED library should
be installed to support the LEDs in the [cabinets marquee](./hardware/cabinet).
LED support can be disabled in the configuration if no LEDs are going to be installed.

## Configuration

The Galagino code can be configured through the [galagino/config.h](galagino/config.h)
file. This is also the place where it's possible to choose between the ILI9341
controller (default) and the ST7789.

Also the pin assignment can be adjusted as well as the TFT SPI clock or the
use of LEDs for the marquee.
